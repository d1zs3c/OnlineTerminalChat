# OnlineTerminalChat
Using these scripts you will be able to communicate with anyone in the world via a terminal in an encrypted way. Set up an initial password and a 32-bit password to encrypt the message when sending it.

Yo need to execute firts the script "launch_serverchat.sh" and in another terminal the script "launch_client.sh" with two parameters. The ip and port provided to you by ngrok. Have fun :)
